If you mean the username and password are entered in a form on a login page, then cURL can "submit" that form like:

curl -d "username=miniape&password=SeCrEt" http://whatever.com/login

and if you want to store the cookie that comes back you do so by specifying a cookie file:

curl -c cookies.txt -d "username=miniape&password=SeCrEt" http://whatever.com/login

and to use those cookie in later requests you do:

curl -b cookies.txt -d "username=miniape&password=SeCrEt" http://whatever.com/login

or do both if you want to both send and receive cookies:

curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -d "username=miniape&password=SeCrEt" http://whatever.com/login
